# Bug Fixes Summary for app.frontend/lib/blocks

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Import/Export Inconsistency in ui.tsx
**Location:** `app.frontend/lib/blocks/ui.tsx`
**Issue:** Several components had both named and default exports, but the main UI file was inconsistently importing them. Some imports used default imports while others used named imports, which could cause runtime errors.

**Components affected:**
- `InstagramLatestPost` - was using default import, changed to named import
- `SpotifyEmbed` - was using default import, changed to named import  
- `SpotifyPlayingNow` - was using default import, changed to named import
- `TikTokFollowerCount` - was using default import, changed to named import
- `TikTokLatestPost` - was using default import, changed to named import

**Fix:** Changed all imports to use named exports consistently to avoid potential import resolution issues.

### 2. Memory Leak in Reaction Component
**Location:** `app.frontend/lib/blocks/reaction/ui.tsx`
**Issue:** The reaction component creates setTimeout timers for debouncing but doesn't clean them up when the component unmounts. This could cause memory leaks and potential errors if the component is unmounted while a timer is still running.

**Fix:** Added a useEffect cleanup function to clear the debounce timer when the component unmounts:
```typescript
// Cleanup timer on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (debounceTimer) {
      clearTimeout(debounceTimer);
    }
  };
}, [debounceTimer]);
```

### 3. Accessibility Issues - Missing Alt Text
**Location:** Multiple components
**Issue:** Several images had empty alt attributes which is poor for accessibility.

**Components fixed:**
- `app.frontend/lib/blocks/header/ui-client.tsx` - Avatar image now has "Profile avatar" alt text
- `app.frontend/lib/blocks/link-box/ui-server.tsx` - Icon images now have "Link icon" alt text

**Fix:** Added meaningful alt text to improve accessibility for screen readers.

## Additional Notes

### Issues Not Fixed (External Dependencies)
- Multiple TypeScript errors related to missing `@trylinky/prisma` exports - these appear to be missing dependencies rather than bugs in the blocks code
- Missing SVG asset files - these are build/dependency issues rather than code bugs
- Package manager configuration issues - the project uses Yarn but npm was used for installation

### Code Quality Observations
- The blocks are generally well-structured with proper error handling
- Most components properly handle loading states and error conditions
- The setTimeout usage in map/form.tsx is appropriate as it's a one-time operation
- Console.error usage in reaction component is appropriate for error logging

## Summary
Fixed 3 main categories of bugs:
1. **Import consistency** - preventing potential runtime errors
2. **Memory leak prevention** - proper cleanup of timers
3. **Accessibility improvements** - better alt text for images

The blocks codebase is generally well-written with good error handling and loading states. The main issues were related to import consistency and proper cleanup of side effects.
