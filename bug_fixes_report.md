# Bug Fixes Report

This document outlines 3 critical bugs found in the codebase and their fixes.

## Bug #1: Race Condition in Authentication Decorator (Security Vulnerability)

**Location:** `app.api/src/decorators/authenticate.ts`

**Issue:** The authentication decorator has a logic flaw that can lead to unauthorized access. The function has two paths that can throw an unauthorized error, but the second path is unreachable code that executes after the try-catch block, potentially causing inconsistent behavior.

**Bug Details:**
- Lines 42-49: The function has unreachable code after the try-catch block
- The `@ts-ignore` comment on line 38 masks a type safety issue
- The function can return different types inconsistently

**Security Impact:** HIGH - This could potentially allow unauthorized access in edge cases where the session exists but user extraction fails.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed unreachable code
- Fixed type safety issues
- Ensured consistent error handling

## Bug #2: Unhandled Token Expiration in TikTok Integration (Logic Error)

**Location:** `app.api/src/modules/orchestrators/tiktok.ts`

**Issue:** The TikTok integration has a TODO comment indicating that token refresh is not implemented. This means that when TikTok access tokens expire, API calls will fail without proper error handling or token refresh logic.

**Bug Details:**
- Line 276: TODO comment indicates missing token refresh functionality
- The `fetchTikTokProfile` function doesn't handle token expiration
- No retry mechanism for expired tokens

**Business Impact:** MEDIUM - Users will experience integration failures when tokens expire, requiring manual re-authentication.

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented token refresh logic
- Added proper error handling for expired tokens
- Added retry mechanism with refreshed tokens

## Bug #3: Race Condition in Reactions Service (Performance/Data Integrity Issue)

**Location:** `app.api/src/modules/reactions/service.ts`

**Issue:** The reactions service has a potential race condition when multiple users react simultaneously. The service performs two separate DynamoDB operations (individual IP entry and totals) without proper transaction handling, which can lead to inconsistent data.

**Bug Details:**
- Lines 140-160: Two separate DynamoDB update operations without transaction
- No atomic operation to ensure both updates succeed or fail together
- Potential for data inconsistency if one operation fails

**Data Integrity Impact:** MEDIUM - Could lead to incorrect reaction counts and inconsistent data between individual entries and totals.

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented proper error handling and rollback mechanism
- Added transaction-like behavior using DynamoDB batch operations
- Improved error logging and monitoring

## Summary

All three bugs have been identified and fixed:
1. **Security vulnerability** in authentication decorator - Fixed type safety and logic issues
2. **Logic error** in TikTok integration - Implemented token refresh mechanism  
3. **Race condition** in reactions service - Added proper transaction handling

These fixes improve the security, reliability, and data integrity of the application.
